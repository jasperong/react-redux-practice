# Weather App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is a simple weather app created using ReactJS, and the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org) API.

Live link can be found [HERE](http://codepen.io/jasperong/full/mRZWgQ/).

Please note that the app's autocomplete functionality in codepen is incomplete. 
It is using a different package from the one found here in the repo.
